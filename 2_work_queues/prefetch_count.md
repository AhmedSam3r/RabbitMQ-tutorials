The `prefetch_count` setting in RabbitMQ's `basic_qos` method is used to control the number of unacknowledged messages that a consumer can have at any given time. It helps regulate the workload distribution among consumers by limiting how many messages RabbitMQ will deliver to a consumer before waiting for acknowledgments.

When `prefetch_count` is set to 1, it means that RabbitMQ will send only one message to a consumer at a time. The consumer must acknowledge or reject the message before another one is dispatched. This ensures that a consumer doesn't receive a new message until it has processed and acknowledged the previous one.

*** "even distribution" refers to the distribution of tasks across the workers, not the distribution of the number of messages. Even if one worker is consistently handling heavier tasks, the distribution is still considered "even" because RabbitMQ is unaware of the specific workload each task entails.***

Here's why a `prefetch_count` of 1 is often used:

1. **Workload Balancing:**
   - With a `prefetch_count` of 1, RabbitMQ distributes messages more evenly among consumers. Each consumer gets one message at a time, preventing situations where one consumer is overloaded while others are idle.

2. **Orderly Processing:**
   - Setting `prefetch_count` to 1 helps maintain the order of message processing. Each consumer processes messages in the order they are received, reducing the chance of out-of-sequence processing.

3. **Efficient Resource Usage:**
   - By limiting the number of unacknowledged messages, you prevent situations where messages are sent to consumers that might be slow to process them. This helps in more efficient resource usage.

The value of `prefetch_count` can be adjusted based on your specific requirements and the characteristics of your workload. In scenarios where strict ordering and balanced distribution are crucial, a value of 1 is often suitable. However, in other situations, you might choose a different value depending on your use case and performance considerations.
